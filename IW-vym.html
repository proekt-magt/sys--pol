<h1>Requirements (considering the acceptance criteria for the CEUR publications):</h1>
	  <p>
1. Papers must be related to Computer Science, Information Systems, or Information Technologies fields.<br>
2. Papers in English of 10–15 pages should be prepared using Springer LNCS layout https://bit.ly/2TSBjGr and submitted as MS Word 2003 .doc files with appropriate list of references formatted according to the Springer rules: https://bit.ly/2RjiVZc .

References must include DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) if they exist. Paper example http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2608/paper14.pdf.<br>
3. The title of the paper should not be longer than 13 words (including prepositions) and should correspond exactly to the research results which are discussed in the paper.<br>
4. In the authors’ list, the affiliated institutions, including town/city and country, are to be listed directly below the names of the authors. The authors are encouraged to include their ORCIDs in superscript next to their names as well as their email addresses.<br>
5. Papers should generally include the following sections: Abstract; Keywords; Introduction; Related Works; Materials/Methods/Methodology; Experiment/Results/Discussions; Conclusion; References.<br>
6. The abstract should briefly summarize the contents of the paper of no less than 150 words and no more than 250 words.<br>
7. Introduction and Related Works sections should describe detailly the current state of the problem with the references to appropriate works. The authors are obliged to use the results of international research. All references should be presented in English and be modern (not older than 5-8 years).<br>
8. The list of references must not be very short or long. The authors should not use a narrow circle of authors in references. The number of referencing to one author should not exceed 2-3. Self-citation must not exceed 20%.<br>
9. At the end of the Related Works section, it is necessary to define the unsolved part of the problem and to formulate the aim of the research.<br>
10. It is strongly recommended to divide the original paper into theoretical and practical sections.<br>
11. The theoretical part of the research should be presented in Materials/Methods/Methodology section and must describe detailly the methodology, models, methods, and techniques used to solve the current problem except to the papers containing reviews of the current state of the scientific research in the specific field. This section can be divided into subsections with appropriate titles.<br>
12. The practical part of the research should be presented in Experiment, Results and Discussions section, and can be divided into subsections as well. This section should describe the experiment or computer simulation, obtained results, and detailed discussion of them.<br>
13. The Conclusions section should present the solved problem, the summary of the proposed models/methods/methodology, and obtained results. This section must be of at least 250 words and at most 400 words length.<br>
14. The quality of all figures should be high enough for good reproduction during CEUR publication.<br>
15. All abbreviations in the text of the paper should be preliminary explained.<br>

<h1>ETHICS AND PERMISSIONS:</h1>
<p>
The results of the research presented in the paper must be original.<br>

However, if figures, tables, animations, or text quotations from copyrighted works (including websites) are included in the paper, permission must be obtained from the copyright holder (usually the original publisher) and the author(s) for both the print and the online format.</p>

<h1>AVOIDANCE OF SELF-PLAGIARISM:</h1>
<p>
A certain overlap in scientific content between papers by the same author is standard practice and to be expected. However, it is essential that transparency is retained and appropriate references included. Permission must be obtained from other publishers, where appropriate.</p>
   


<h1>PEER-REVIEWING</h1>
<p>
All paper submissions will be double-blind peer reviewed. All submitted papers will be sent to at least three Program Committee members and, if necessary, additional independent reviewers.<br>
Reviews of submissions should be based on relevance to Computer Science (Information Technologies, Information Systems) field, readability, novelty and originality of the contribution to the research of risk-informed systems, readability, quality, significance, and clarity of scientific results. The review result will be announced to the authors by email along with reviewers’ comments, if any.<br>
Only the papers selected by the Program Committee and presented at the workshop will be submitted for online publication as a separate collection of CEUR.<br>
“No-show” papers won’t be included in the Workshop Proceedings.<br>
Please read complete call for papers guidelines before submitting your paper.<br>
